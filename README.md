# 🧾 Order Processor Microservices App

Im planning to build a scalable, event-driven microservices application using:

- 🛰️ **gRPC** for fast internal service-to-service communication (queries)
- ⚙️ **Apache Kafka** for asynchronous commands (create order, process payment, etc.)
- 💳 **Stripe integration** for payments
- 📦 **Docker** for containerization
- 🧬 **Protocol Buffers** for structured, performant communication
